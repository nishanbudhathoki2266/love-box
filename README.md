# love-box

An IoT based project, love-box inspired from https://en.lovebox.love/. The love-box will make you and your loved ones happier by sharing special affections.

So how it works?
1 -> Send messages to the Lovebox through an app.
2 -> The love box receives your message at the other end.
3 -> The heart of the Lovebox immediately rotates when your loved one gets a message (on the other end). It continues rotating until your loved one opens the box and reads the message.
4 -> Your loved one can then close the box and wait until next message ;)

summary -> Nobody expects to receive love notes by text every morning, but everyone loves receiving sweet notes on their Lovebox when they wake up! ;)

The technical aspects:

- A python framework 'Flask' is used to create an API for receiving messages.
  Also serving html pages to the front end is done using Flask.
- On the front end, all core technologies like HTML, CSS and JS along with some SaSS are used. BEM class names can also be discovered in this project.
